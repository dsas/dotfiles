# My dotfiles

These are some of my common dotfiles for bash, vim, git, etc. 

## Install

Back up your existing dotfiles first.

- `git clone git://github.com/dsas/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `./install.py`


## Afters
Read through the dotfiles and adjust as necessary, otherwise you'll be committing
things as dsas and so on.

## Thanks
