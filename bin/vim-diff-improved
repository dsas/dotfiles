# Use *real* vimdiff to edit merge conflicts in Git
#
# Layout:
#
#   Tab1 is the MERGED or 'result' file that contains the conflict markers.
#       +--------------------------------+
#       |       <<<<<<< HEAD             |
#       |        LCONFL                  |
#       |       =======                  |
#       |        RCONFL                  |
#       |       >>>>>>> someref          |
#       +--------------------------------+
#   Tab2 is a three-way diff of the original files and the merge base.
#       +--------------------------------+
#       |  LOCAL   |   BASE   |  REMOTE  |
#       +--------------------------------+
#   Tab3 is a two-way diff of the conflicts.
#       +--------------------------------+
#       |    LCONFL     |    RCONFL      |
#       +--------------------------------+
#
# Workflow:
#
# 1.    Save your changes to the $MERGED file (the first tab also the only
#       file that isn't read-only).
# 2.    The LOCAL, BASE, and REMOTE versions of the file are available in the
#       second tabpage if you want to look at them.
# 3.	The third tab is a two-way diff of the conflicts if you want to look.
#
# Add this mergetool to your ~/.gitconfig (you can substitute gvim for vim):
#
# git config --global merge.tool diffconflicts
# git config --global mergetool.diffconflicts.cmd 'vim-diff-improved vim $BASE $LOCAL $REMOTE $MERGED'
# git config --global mergetool.diffconflicts.trustExitCode true
# git config --global mergetool.diffconflicts.keepBackup false
